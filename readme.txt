Once you have composed your mail, it will display automatically on the send mail page. [More Info](http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2010/09/25/email-newsletter/)

= Send Mail to a Registered User =

Use this page for sending mails to registered users. On this page you find the email addresses of all registered users listed with a check box option. If you don't want to mail any particular user(s), you can uncheck the email(s) on this list. After you selected the users, click on the email subject you first created and press the Send Mail button.  [More Info](http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2010/09/25/email-newsletter/)

= Send Mail to Users who Contacted You =

This plugin now comes with a 'Simple Contact Form'. I thought it would be useful to combine this feature with the newsletter plugin. After installing the contact form, your site visitors may contact you using this form. Those users then are visible to you on this page, and you can email them by using the same procedure as outlined before click here. [More Info](http://www.gopiplus.com/work/2010/09/25/email-newsletter/)

Install the plugin 'Simple Contact Form' on your site. If it is not useful to you, omit this menu.
